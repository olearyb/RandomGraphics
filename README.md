# RandomGraphics
This project is a fairly simple python graphical window that generates random circles of a particular colour palette.

# PREREQUISITES
For this application to run, you will need python installed on your machine. IDLE 3.8 for Mac was used in the development of this project. 
You can download the latest python installer via the following website: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/

# INSTRUCTIONS
The RandomCircles.py file contains all the code needed to run this graphical window. Once you run this file, you will need to enter one of the functions along with some conditions, for example:

`functionName(n)` where n is an integer (whole number). 
I would recommend keeping this number quite large.

`neon(10000)` hit enter within the shell and the graphical window will display, followed by n nunmber of randomly generated circles in the colour palette of your choice (each function name is a different colour palette).
